The sarge package provides a wrapper for subprocess which provides command

pipelines with a Posix flavour: you can have chains of commands using ;, &,
pipes using | and |&, and redirection.

The sarge package requires Python 2.6 or greater, and can be
installed with the standard Python installation procedure:
